# Hospital-Revenue-Cycle-Analysis
# Revenue Cycle Optimization Project

## Overview
This project uses a Jupyter Notebook to analyze hospital operational data and optimize the revenue cycle. It includes KPI tracking, data visualization, and predictive modeling to help understand revenue-impacting factors in healthcare.

## Project Goals
- **Optimize Revenue Cycle**: Use data to identify patterns in patient admissions and discharges that impact revenue.
- **KPI Tracking**: Develop Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as average stay duration and admission deposits to monitor hospital efficiency.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Use linear regression to predict admission deposits based on patient demographics and hospital metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset used is [Analytics for Hospital’s Healthcare Data](https://www.kaggle.com/dinocojagadeeshr/analytics-for-hospitals-healthcare-data) from Kaggle, containing information on hospital operations, patient admissions, and discharges.

## Key Components
- **Revenue_Cycle_Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing all analysis, data cleaning, KPI calculations, and the predictive model.

## Results
- **KPI Insights**: Calculated average stay durations and admission deposits by department, providing insights into resource utilization.
- **Predictive Model**: Linear regression model estimates admission deposits, aiding in revenue prediction and budget planning.
- **Visualizations**: Created graphs for department-wise stay durations and deposit amounts to support data-driven decisions.

## How to Run
1. **Download the dataset** from Kaggle and place it in the same directory as the notebook (or update the notebook path if needed).
2. Open `Revenue_Cycle_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Requirements
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Future Work

	•	Implement more complex models for improved accuracy.
	•	Create a dashboard to track KPIs in real time.
